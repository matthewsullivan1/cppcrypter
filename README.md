# Usage
## main.cpp
make main.exe: compiles main program
./main.exe [args]: encrypts and embeds payload into stub_\*.cpp, written to /stub
make clean: deletes main.exe, clears /stub and /out directories
## Flags
-h --help: display all flags
-p: display paths for payload, stub output dir, stub template, and exit
-n <name>: set a name for the stub. output will be stub_name.cpp/exe
-c --compile: compile stub immediately. makefile must be configured properly 
--payload <C:\Path\To\Payload>: specify payload. first exe found in /bin will be used by default 
## Obfuscation flags 
--rand: adds two random memory allocations before payload is executed 
--vm: checks if the application is being ran in a virtual machine, and exits if so
--db: checks if the application is being ran in a debugger, and exits if so
--dyn: dynamically resolves certain Windows API calls at runtime
stub_\*.cpp
make stub: compiles each stub_*.cpp in /stub. stub_*.exe is placed in /out
