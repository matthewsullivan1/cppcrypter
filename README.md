The default payload search path in main is in /bin, so any 64 bit executable payload should be placed there. This is done automatically if the payload is built using the TARGET_PL Makefile rule. The stub template that the complete stub is built from is in /resource, and the compiled stubs are placed in /out. When using additional options for the stub, the same template is always used and the additional options are written in using commented placeholders in the template. 

##Project Directory Structure  
    bin - Contains payload binary  
    include - Contains openssl header files needed for compilation  
    lib - Contains openssl libraries needed for linking  
    out - Output directory for compiled stub  
    resource - Contains stub template file and payload source files

    ##src  
    Contains main source files. Constant.h contains strings that can be embedded in the stub, color codes, and AES block size. Flags.h defines two enumerations and global arrays to handle arguments and stub writing operations. Utils.h contains function prototypes for readBinary, generateKeyAndIV, encrypt, writeStub, as well as the associated helper functions. 

Usage: 
    1. Initial Setup
        - Compile main program
            make main.exe
        - main.exe will be placed in the base project directory. For help:
            ./main.exe --help 
            ./main.exe -h

    2. Building Payload
        - Update the Makefile variable PL_SRC to point to the payload.cpp source file in /resource
        - Update any g++ flags needed for compiling the payload in PL_FLAGS 
        - The source file for the payload should be in /resource
            make bin/payload.exe
        - payload.exe will be compiled and placed in /bin



    3. Building a Stub with no Flags
        - When main.exe is run with no flags, it will look for a payload 'bin.exe' in /bin
            ./main.exe
        - The resulting stub source file will be written to /stub as stub_*.cpp
            - Note: Sometimes the stub does not write out properly. Simply rename it with .cpp or rerun main.exe. 

        - The stub can be compiled using
            make stub           (to build every stub_*.cpp)
            make stub_*.exe     (to build a specific stub)
        - The compiled stub.exe(s) will be in /out


    4. Additional Flags
        - To compile the stub in the same run that the source is written, use -c
            ./main.exe -c 

        - To specify a payload that isn't bin.exe, use --payload 
            ./main.exe --payload pl.exe
            ./main.exe --payload "C:\\Users\\local\\Desktop\\pl.exe"
        - Either the full path or the name of the payload in /bin can be used

        - Currently, these are the additional options for stub obfuscation
            --rand  :   adds two random memory allocations between 50-100mb, and verifies that malloc() succeeded on both before executing the payload. Also changes names
